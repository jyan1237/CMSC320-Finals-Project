This will be the github repository for my 320s finals project.

Data sets:

(Video Game Ratings by IGN): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/ign-games-from-best-to-worst 

(Video Game Sales): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

  I spend so much time a week playing video games so I think that I should gain a better understanding of the medium as a whole. Thus I chose these two data sets because I’m interested in how various factors may influence a video game’s success. So I plan on combining two metrics, namely the game sales and a well known game reviewer as a rough gauge for success. Meanwhile I can check the impact of various factors such as release date, genre, publisher, platform etc.
